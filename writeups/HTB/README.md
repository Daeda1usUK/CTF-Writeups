# HTB Writeups

Here are the (Very rough) writeups from CTF challanges within HTB. These range from my first ever as a beginner to modern day. They were personal learning notes and are not the best written, more for my own notetaking.

Around 50 Machines have been rooted on my account https://app.hackthebox.com/profile/overview (Daeda1us) This repo just makes up some of the notes i took in my early days.

Some walkthroughs were used for some of these machines as I was still a beginner upon starting HTB
